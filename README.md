# TransportSystemSEN

##About this project
In this project, I am going to design a system that can store details of passengers, drivers/passenger assistant, education providers/other services and transport companies.

There will be a lot of features within this system as well. This system is based on what I use on a daily basis for my work. Some of the features that I use are the following:

**Internal Database** - Company made a database for the above information but the system is due to come to the end of life.

**Spreadsheets** - Use this to colate the informations.

I will design a that group together these systems into one system.

This will be my first project in the field of software development created and designed by myself.
